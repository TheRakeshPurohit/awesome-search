Working on a guide for those underfunded search teams out there. Really just
my notes on what seems to work well in search from measuring the problem to early 0->1 
experiments to some notes on effectively "blazing new paths" to production to gain new 
types of leverage on relevance. Enjoy! - https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2023/05/29/guide-for-search-teams.html

Interested what people think is the tipping point for an "underfunded" team to consider 
moving search to an external provider e.g. bloomreach/algolia/google retail search. 
Are the relevance gains coming from these services worth the relinquishing of control 
of discovery?

I feel that people underestimate their ability to influence search applications 
even when they use external providers. There are usually ways to affect the experience 
by changes in indexing or query rewriting that are at least somewhat engine-agnostic. 
It’s not the complete freedom of managing your own stack, but for many folks it’s probably 
the right compromise, especially to avoid managing and staffing 
infrastructure and operations.
